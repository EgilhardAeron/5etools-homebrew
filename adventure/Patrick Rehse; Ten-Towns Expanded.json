										"I can tell from experience how great of a campaign {@i Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden} is. My favorite one so far, to be honest. Chapter 1 needs to cover a lot of ground. The designers focused more on creating entertaining quests than fleshing out descriptive elements of the towns; a good approach when you have a limited number of pages available. To bring the town descriptions up to the same level and lighten the burden on DMs preparing for their games, I felt the need to create this supplement.",
										"At first, this project started humbly with only a few pages of notes. But the longer I worked on creating interesting and interconnected locations; the more pages I filled. In the end the page count was much higher than I had anticipated, so I put even more effort into the production to make it a comprehensive supplement DMs would consider using while preparing for their campaign.",

								"Most folks prefer dogs over axe beaks because they are generally easier to breed, train, and require less food. Thus, dogs are more often offered for rent or sale in stables. Axe beaks have some advantages over dogs, as only four are needed to pull a sled as compared to six dogs, plus they are 25 percent faster, each pulling up to 420 pounds. However, dogs require only half a ration per day, while axe beaks require two.

Enraged by this charge, the merchant paid his fine in 2000 cp stored in two small chests that he dropped onto the clerk's desk. They will not yield the position, with Prudence arguing that she can't reasonably accept and count a fine paid this way, while the merchant insisting there is no rule prohibiting it. Characters can help resolve the situation by either offering to help Prudence count the coin, which will take two hours to do, or exchange the coin with their own. Optionally, they can convince one side to give in with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check. If they side against the merchant, he is likely to hold a grudge against them. In the future, the characters might find themselves unable to buy something or denied lodging at a local inn because the merchant has called in a favor to punish the characters."

Numerous gaping holes encircled with burn marks are covered in canvas.",

A hole in the ceiling allows for goods to be lifted to higher floors. The floor is covered in soot. Countless footprints carve a network of tracks leading to a damaged spiral staircase and many doors that lead to small adjoining workrooms. At the far end of the foyer stands a 6-foot-tall steel construct supporting a 2-foot-diameter gearwheel which serves as an altar to Gond, the god of craft. Eight Gond Bells (worth 10 gp each) are attached to the massive gear, one from every gear tooth.",

Her light grey skin is covered in dirt. She is only 3-foot tall, which is small, even small among gnomes.

He is willing to pay 75 gp if the characters bring him the carcass of a freshly slain craig cat, yeti, or snowy owlbear as proof that the immediate danger has been dealt with.
