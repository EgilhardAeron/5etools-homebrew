Baerick and those loyal to him imported loads of the Chardalyn to make weapons and armor, but eventually fell under the corruption of the evil magic within the material. These dwarves split off from the Battlehammer dwarves of the Dwarven Valley and laid claim to the eastern side of the valley, which the Valley Dwarves now refer to as the Halls of Black Ice.",

After many confrontations with the Black Ice Dwarves and with the help of some adventurers, 'Stokely's boys' were able to save most of the Black Ice Dwarves from irreversible corruption.",

To make matters worse, Auril's minions have recently taken notice of the dwarves' comfort in their underground hovels and are actively working to instill fear in their hearts. A frost druid by the name of Verna began growing thorny shrubs in the Halls of Black Ice so that she could awaken them and unleash them upon the Valley Dwarves."

The cap's leathery surface can be cut and cleaned for use in making maps, hats, and scrolls (its surface takes on dyes and inks well). The stalk can be cleaned, soaked in water for an hour, then dried to make a palatable food akin to bread. Each trillimac stalk provides {@dice 1d6 + 4} pounds of food."
